// This service worker file is generated by Workbox during the build process.
// The actual service worker logic is in src/service-worker.js
// which gets compiled and injected by workbox-webpack-plugin during `npm run build`

// For development, this is a placeholder.
// In production, this file is replaced with the Workbox-generated service worker.
