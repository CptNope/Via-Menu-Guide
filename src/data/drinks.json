Exceptionally smooth with honey, delicate smoke, fruit, and vanilla. Complex, elegant, and prestigious—the pinnacle of blended Scotch. Master blender hand-selects only 1 in 10,000 casks for Blue Label. Each bottle is individually numbered and comes in a silk-lined presentation box. Created for special celebrations, milestone moments, and serious collectors. The ultimate gift. Perfect neat or with a single cube—adding water would be unnecessary. Pairs exquisitely with finest cuisine: wagyu beef, lobster thermidor, premium cigars, and luxury chocolates. Icon blend that represents 200 years of blending expertise. This is Johnnie Walker's masterpiece.",
